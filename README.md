# Introduction

Largely based on my experience being the most hacked and abused person ever.

Random:
- Elliptic curves are supposedly not secure because there are backdoors in them
- Bitlocker is not secure, many know or have backdoors
- Locking your phone does not help, at all. They have backdoors.
- Airplane mode on your phone does not help. They can access your phone anyway.
- Hardware is modified
- SHA2-384 is supposedly much better than others, no idea why
- MFA is not a good solution. It is very old and has always been shit. No idea why everyone uses it.
- Of course MTAN is bad too.
- Yubikeys have unfixable vulns
- Hiding data in DNA and the like = there are forensic techniques for that
- Security by or through obscurity really really does not work
- If your eyes are modified, then looking at things will steal your data
- Zero knowledge is not a good solution
- Air-gapped systems don't work, you have to get data there somewhere which is intercepted
